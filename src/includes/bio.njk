            At <a href="https://tokopedia.com">Tokopedia</a>, I involve in core and innovation team
            for web platform, a small but fast-paced central team that helps other teams leverage their 
            possibility. I maintain a big scale of web microservices and make sure all of core 
            functionalities work well without sacrificing productivity and operation velocity. I also evaluate
            and improve Tokopedia web application, where I do research software problems, conduct proof of concept, diagnostics, 
            and bring fine-grained results to production. I mostly collaborate with multi-disciplinary team of
            engineers on a wide range of problems. In my spare time, I'd like to learn computing disciplines, running, and reading variety of books.
